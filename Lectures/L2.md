# Real-Time Scheduling (P1)

## Timing constraints: origin and characterization

Computations must be:
- Logically correct
- Produced in time

The main objectives of **Real-Time Systems** (RTS) is to develop appropriate techniques for:

1. Design / Synthesis
2. Analysis
3. Verification

## Special features of Real-Time Systems

- Execution time of its computations
- Response time to events
- Regularity of generating periodic events

## Requirements of Real-Time Systems

- Functional
- Temporal
- Dependability

### Functional requiremts

Examples:
- Acquiring environment data
- Direct Digital Control (DDC)
- Human-Machine Interface (HMI)

### Temporal Requirements

jitter increases or mantains while time passes.

Real-time constraints:
- **Soft** - The value keeps some utility to the application even after a deadline D, despite possible degradation
- **Firm** - The associated value loses any utility to the application after a deadline D
- **Hard** - Time constraint that, when not met, may generate a catastrophic failure (critical control)

# Real-Time Scheduling (P2)

## Computing models

**Transformational model**:
- A program starts and finishes, transforming input in output results

**Reactive model**:
- Indefinite execution of interactions, for example operating over a continuous input data stream

**Real-Time model**:
- Reactive model in which the output and the input streams need to be synchronized, thus imposing time constraints

## Determinism vs Predictability

**Determinism**:
- Feeding a program with the same sequence of data inputs originates the same sequence of data outputs (logical property)

**Predictability**:
- Determinism with a known delay or within a known time window (logical and temporal property)

## Real-Time Model

**Task (recurrent)**:
- Infinite sequence of activations, each executing a set of operations (a given function).

Worst-Case Execution Time - (C)

### Recurrency arrivals

Activation patterns (lead to different interference patterns):
- Periodic
  - Activations separated by the same time interval (an=n*T+@)

- Sporadic
  - Minimal time between consecutive activations (we do not know when the task was activated, we do not control the interference, but we know what it might me)

- Aperiodic
  - It is not possible to enforce an interference

### Task requirements

**Temporal**:
- Time constraints on the finishing instants or for generating 
certain output events

**Precedence**:
- Establish a certain order of execution among tasks

**Resource usage**:
- Need for using shared resources. May imply the use of atomic operations (which execution sequence cannot be interrupted)

## Preemption

Being able to suspend a task with the motivation to resume its functioning later, due to different priorities.

## Temporal control

Triggering tasks can be done by:
- By time
- By events

## Task scheduling

- Sequence of tasks execution in one or more processors
- Function of R+ (time) onto N0+ (task set), creates a correspondence between a time point and running task
- A `schedule` is said to be **feasible** if it meets all the constaints associated to the task set
- A `task set` is said to be **schedulable** if there is at least one feasible schedule for that task set 

## Scheduling problem

Input:
- Task set
- Constraints

Find an assignment of processor time to tasks that allows:
- Executing tasks completely

The method to solve a scheduling problem is the scheduling algorithm.

## Preliminary algorithms

**EDD - Earliest Due Date**:
Execute the task which deadline is next in non-decreasing order.

**EDF - Earliest Deadline First**:
Reorder the tasks in each instance, tipically online. Can also be offline if the activations are periodic.

**BB - Branch and Bound**:
Schedule construction by exhaustive search in the space of possible permutations (schedule tree), O(n!).
